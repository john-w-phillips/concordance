# This is an example 'special words' file.  Each word in the file is
# 'special' and periods in it should not be treated as sentence
# enders.  If a line begins with nonender: or prefix:, the special
# word on that line will not be treated as being able to end a
# sentence, while otherwise it would.  For example the text "My name
# is so-and-so, Ph.D. How are you?"  would normally be parsed as two
# sentences, since Ph.D. ends with a period, and 'How' is
# capitalized. But if Ph.D. was in this file as 'nonender:Ph.D.', that
# would mean that it couldn't end sentences. This is useful for
# prefixes also (prefix: and nonender: are the same).
